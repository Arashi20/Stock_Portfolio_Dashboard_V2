# Stock Reporting Tool

During the first iteration of this project I initially added a portfolio overview, but as I didn't really use that (as I could just use the portfolio overview from my stock brokerage), I decided to get rid of that feature completely and instead focus on making an application focused on stock analyses.

The main features will be the same as the previous web app, namely:
- DCF Page: perform Discounted Free Cashflow analyses by filling in the numbers (based on your own assumptions) and letting the application do the rest of the calculations. 
- Reports Page: Add notes and due diligence insights on certain stocks (+ integrations with other DCF page and wishlist page).
- Wishlist Page: This page is used to add stocks to my wishlist with real-time price info as well.


# Infrastructure

Similar to the previous project, I will be using Flask for the backend and HTML+CSS+JS for the frontend. The design of the web application will be very similar to the previous iteration, but it might have some better aesthetic improvements and some quality-of-life improvements. 

The web app will be hosted on Railway, again under the same URL: amstocks.nl
