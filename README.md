### 🏛️ 13F Filings
- Browse institutional investors' quarterly holdings straight from SEC's official API
- Full portfolio sorted by position weight, with tickers resolved from CUSIPs
- Quarter-over-quarter diff: new buys, added, trimmed, and positions sold out completely
- Filter to just new buys for idea generation
- Search all ~8,800 funds that file 13F, from a bundled index (`sec/filers.csv`)
- Quick-pick chips for favourite funds, configured in `sec/funds.py`

> **What 13F data is and isn't:** filings are due 45 days after quarter-end and cover
> long US-listed equity positions only — no shorts, bonds, foreign listings or cash.
> Everyone gets the data at the same moment, so it's a source of names to research,
> not a way to get ahead of the market.

### 🏠 Home Page
